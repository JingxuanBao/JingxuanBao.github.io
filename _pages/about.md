I am currently a master student in [Applied Mathematics and Computational Science (AMCS)](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu) program at University of Pennsylnavia (Upenn). I am also a student researcher working with [Dr. Li Shen](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9075258) and [Dr. Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931). Before joining Upenn, I received the dual degree of Bachelor of Science with Honours (Class I) in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/undergraduate/applied-mathematics) from The University of Liverpool and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. 

My dream is to become an excellent biomedical researcher, where my research interest is developing and applying modern statistical and computational methods to solve biological and biomedical problems.
