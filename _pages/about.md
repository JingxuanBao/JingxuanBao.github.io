Hello, welcome to my personal website. I am currently a master student in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science program (https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/) at University of Pennsylnavia. My dream is to become an excellent biomedical researcher so that in the future thousands or even millions of patients will stop suffering from their illness because of my researches. 

From my perspective, an excellent biomedical researcher should equip three capabilities, a progressive view of biomedical problems, a proficient level of computer programming, and a solid background of mathematics and statistics. To prepare myself to become an excellent biomedical researcher, I participated in numbers of biomedical research projects. For each research experience, I learned a lot about the topics in biomedical researches and I become more and more familiar with various programming language such as R, Matlab, and Python. Moverover, in my undergraduate years, I have taken a wide range of courses in mathematics and its related fields, which cover from the most basic topics such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Analysis to some more advanced topics such as Numerical Analysis, Optimization Theory, and Statistical Distribution Theory. To further enhance my mathematical and statistical foundations, I choose to study for the masterâ€™s program in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science at University of Pennsylvania. After my first year of study, I learned and understood more deeper concepts of mathematics. I studied several Ph.D. level courses in both mathematics and statistics. I learned Complex Analysis, Real Analysis and Probability Theory based on the Measure Theory, which helped me have a better understanding when I was studying Statistical Inference. I also learned two applied statistical courses named Bayesian Statistics and Statistical Methods for Categorical and Survival Data.
