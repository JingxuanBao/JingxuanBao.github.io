I am currently a master student in [Applied Mathematics and Computational Science (AMCS) program](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu) at University of Pennsylnavia (Upenn). Before joining Upenn, I received the degree of Bachelor of Science with Honours (Class I) in Applied Mathematics from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.

My dream is to become an excellent biomedical researcher, which from my perspective should equip three capabilities, a progressive view of biomedical problems, a proficient level of computer programming, and a solid background of mathematics and statistics.
