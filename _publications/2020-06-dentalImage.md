Despite the great success of machine learning in various biomedical domains, applications to dental hard tissue conditions (primarily on dental Caries, Erosive Tooth Wear (ETW), and Fluorosis) are underexplored, in particular for analyzing photographic images. The clinical diagnostics of these dental hard-tissue conditions is routinely performed by visual examination but is often limited by its subjectivity. To bridge this gap, we apply four categories of machine learning strategies including nine different methods with two different feature representation approaches to estimate the probability and severity of dental hard-tissue conditions from photographic tooth images. 
The empirical study on our real dataset shows the best probability estimation results are Extra Trees Regression (RMSE: 0.010, Pearson correlation: 0.581) for Caries, Decision Tree (RMSE: 0.058, Pearson correlation: 0.615) for ETW, Bayesian ARD Regression (RMSE: 0.068, Pearson correlation: 0.765) for Fluorosis. The best severity estimation results are Extra Trees Regression (RMSE: 0.010, Pearson correlation: 0.684) for Caries, Decision Tree (RMSE: 0.063, Pearson correlation: 0.542) for ETW, Bayesian ARD Regression (RMSE: 0.085, Pearson correlation: 0.610) for Fluorosis. 
Our results indicate that machine learning models provide promising opportunities to improve clinical outcomes and save resources in the management of these dental conditions.
