## Abstract
The structure-function coupling in brain networks has emerged as an important
research topic in modern neuroscience. The structural network could provide the
backbone of the functional network. The integration of the functional network with
structural information can help us better understand functional communication in the
brain. This paper proposed a method to accurately estimate the brain functional
network enriched by the structural network from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.
First, we adopted a simplex regression model with graph-constrained Elastic Net to
construct the functional networks enriched by the structural network. Then, we
compared the constructed network characteristics of this approach with several state-of-
the-art competing functional network models. Furthermore, we evaluated whether
the structural enriched functional network model improves the performance for
predicting the cognitive-behavioral outcomes. The experiments have been performed
on 218 participants from the Human Connectome Project database. The results
demonstrated that our network model improves network consistency and its predictive
performance compared with several state-of-the-art competing functional network
models.
