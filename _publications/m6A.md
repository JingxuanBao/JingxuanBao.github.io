## Abstract
The ISOpureR method uses the gradient decent method to maximize the complete likelihood function of estimating the proper estimators. In this research, we estimate the absolute proportion of m6A specific binding mRNA in the m6A-containing sample (IP sample) with the application of ISOpureR method. We apply the ISOpureR method to simulated data and real data. Our results show that the method performs well under the model of second order median regression in terms of the simulated data with application of regression analysis; and it needs to be further developed when applied to the real data.
