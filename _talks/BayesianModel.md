We first develop a generalized Bayesian factor analysis (GBFA)
framework, a sparse Bayesian factor analysis which can take into
account the graph information. The GBFA framework employs
the spike and slab lasso (SSL) prior to impose sparsity on the
factor loadings and the Markov random field (MRF) prior to
encourage smoothing over the adjacent factor loadings, which
establishes a unified shrinkage adaptive to the loading size and
the graph structure.
