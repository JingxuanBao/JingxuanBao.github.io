We first develop a generalized Bayesian factor analysis (GBFA) framework, a sparse Bayesian factor analysis which can take into account the graph information. The GBFA framework employs the spike and slab lasso (SSL) prior to impose sparsity on the factor loadings and the Markov random field (MRF) prior to encourage smoothing over the adjacent factor loadings, which establishes a unified shrinkage adaptive to the loading size and the graph structure.
