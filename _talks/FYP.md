## Abstract
In this project, we are aiming to analyse the RNA methylation sites in a given set of genes in which the two main tasks are RNA methylation site detection and differential methylation analysis. To estimate the true proportion of the m6A specific binding mRNA, we make
an comparison between the problem of deconvolution of the tumour samples with respect to the normal samples and the problem of deconvolution of the IP samples in terms of the input samples. In this research, we examine two methods, ISOpureR
and CLARKE respectively.
