## Abstract
Advertising agencies (buyers) place television advertisements orders with the networks (sellers) for their desired commercial slots which will expose their products to a particular target audience. Typically, an advertiser needs information on a certain amount of impressions (i.e., views) for each advertising campaign. This project applies two ways, impression based approach and demographic approach, in evaluation of the advertisements orders for a specific company with modified data provided by Clypd. The results show that the impression-based method is more stable while the demographic-based method is more sensitive to different types of customers, prime-time slots, and non-prime time slots. In comparison, the advertising companies should choose the demographic-based method for more accurate results to maximize the profits for both the advertising companies and the networks.
