We use data from Allen Brain Atlas dataset (https://human.brain-map.org/static/download) to develop a biomedical meaningful imaging-genetics biclustering algorithm. Currently, we successfully map the Microarray matrix to the Gene-ROI matrix. We are currently focusing on the literature review of the biclustering methods.
